 Text-Fu :
 >      :  $ echo Hello World  peanuts.txt 
 >>     :  $ echo Hello World >> peanuts.txt 
 <  >   :  $ cat < peanuts.txt > banana.txt     $ ls < peanuts.txt > banana.txt
 2>     :  $ ls peanuts.txt 2> banana.txt : writes only stderr result to the file
 1>     :  $ ls peanuts.txt 1> banana.txt : writes only stdout result to the file
 2>&1   :  $ ls /fake/directory > peanuts.txt 2>&1 : wirtes both stderr and stdout in the file
 |      :  The pipe operator |, represented by a vertical bar, allows us to get the stdout of a command and make that the stdin to another process.$ ls -la /etc | less
